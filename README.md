# PocketManager
Supports:
- HTTP request/hook to shutdown, borg backup, then startup of pocketbase
- Soon: restarting the docker image makes a fresh repull of the PocketManager repo (Will be managed by MaintainerCD. My other container that just restarts containers on webhook)


## Note
Not meant for anyone else to use, but it is here if anyone is interested
